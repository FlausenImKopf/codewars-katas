## Description

Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).
Hint: Don't forget to check for bad values like null/undefined.

Example Array:

```js
[true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true,
true, false, true, false, true, false, false, true,
true, true, true, true, false, false, true, true,]
```
